# CD

Released in 2006, this CD was a long time coming. Several albums had been recorded by the JPPC through 1967, but none after then. This CD showcases the range of musical styles, moods and themes in our repertoire. We hope this selection of choral gems in "Zingt!" - most of which have not been recorded in a choral version before - will delight and inspire you as it has our audiences since its release.

Yiddish, Latin transcription, and full English translation is included with each CD.

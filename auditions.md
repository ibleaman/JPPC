# Can you sing with us?

If you can learn a vocal line, sing in harmony with others, read music or learn quickly from an MP3 recording, and reliably follow a conductor, you're welcome to audition for the Chorus.

Lyrics are transliterated and translated into English.  You don't need to know a lot of Yiddish, but you do need to study the translations and understand the songs.  You don't need to be a fluent Yiddish speaker, but you do need to sing with correct pronunciation and expression.  To help you learn that, we provide MP3 recordings of the spoken lyrics only.  And to help you learn the music, we provide MP3s of each voice section (soprano, alto, tenor, bass).  Most of us learn the language "on the job" and sound like native speakers by concert time â€“ at least while we're singing!

The Chorus rehearses on Monday evenings from 7:00 to 9:30 p.m. in Midtown Manhattan.  The season runs from September through early June, with days off on Jewish holidays and some national holidays.  There are usually two to four additional non-Monday rehearsals for each voice section.  Dates for these sectional rehearsals are determined by consensus and are required for those planning to perform at our concerts.

Concert dates and locations, once confirmed, are included in our [CONCERTS](https://www.yiddishchorus.org/concerts.html) page on this website.

We hope to resume in-person rehearsals in September, 2021.

# Auditions

At your audition, we listen for musicianship, ability to learn pronunciation, and ability to convey the meaning of a text. We also determine your vocal part (soprano, alto, tenor, or bass) and range within that part.  

We ordinarily hold auditions, by appointment only, in Midtown Manhattan during August and September. You may benefit from attending one of our concerts before you audition. Visit our [CONCERTS](https://www.yiddishchorus.org/concerts.html) page on this website for some information about our upcoming concerts.

# Can you sing with us?

If you can learn a vocal line, enjoy singing in harmony with others, read music or learn from an MP3 recording, and follow a conductor, you're welcome to audition for the Chorus.

You don't need to know Yiddish.  Lyrics are translated into English, so that everyone can understand the songs and sing with expression. MP3 recordings are provided to help you learn the music and the correct Yiddish pronunciation.  Most of us learn the language "on the job" and sound like native speakers by concert time â€“ at least while we're singing!

The Chorus rehearses on Monday evenings from 7:00 to 9:00 p.m. in Midtown Manhattan.  The season runs from September through early June, with days off on Jewish holidays and some national holidays.  There are usually three to four additional non-Monday rehearsals for each voice section.  Dates for these sectional rehearsals are determined by consensus and are required to perform at our concerts.

Concert dates and locations, once confirmed, are included in our [CONCERTS](https://www.yiddishchorus.org/concerts.html) page.

# Auditions

At your audition, we listen for musicianship, ability to learn pronunciation, and ability to convey the meaning of a text. We also determine your vocal part (soprano, alto, tenor, or bass) and range within that part.  

We ordinarily hold auditions, by appointment only, in Midtown Manhattan in late August and during September. You may benefit from attending one of our concerts before you audition. Visit our [CONCERTS](https://www.yiddishchorus.org/concerts.html) page.

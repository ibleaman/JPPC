# Can you sing with us?

If you can learn a vocal line, sing in harmony with others, read music or learn quickly from an MP3 recording, and reliably follow a conductor, you are welcome to audition for the Chorus.

Reading or speaking Yiddish is not a requirement. All of our musical texts are transliterated into English, and word-for-word translations are provided. Most of our singers learn the language "on the job" and sound like native Yiddish speakers — at least when singing — by concert time.

The Chorus rehearses Monday evenings (with the exception of Jewish holidays and some national holidays) from 7:00 to 9:30 p.m. at Opera America, 330 Seventh Avenue, between 28th and 29th streets, in Manhattan. Additional separate rehearsals for each vocal part (soprano, alto, tenor, and bass) are held several times during the year. Our first rehearsal this season was October 15, 2018, and our final meeting will be in early June, 2019.

Concert dates and locations, once confirmed, are included in the Concerts page on this website.

# 2018-2019 Season Auditions

We hold auditions, by appointment only, in midtown Manhattan during August and September. You may benefit from attending one of our concerts before you audition. Please visit the Concerts page on this website for some information about our December 2018 and June 2019 concerts.

At your audition, we listen for musicianship, ability to learn pronunciation, and ability to convey the meaning of a text through "acting." We also determine your vocal part (soprano, alto, tenor, or bass) and range within that part.  

For more information, please email the JPPC at [information@thejppc.org](mailto:information@thejppc.org).

# The Yiddish Philharmonic Chorus

![The Yiddish Philharmonic Chorus](img/2010.jpg "The Yiddish Philharmonic Chorus, 2010"){: .rounded .mx-auto .d-block }

The **Yiddish Philharmonic Chorus** is a New York City-based audition chorus dedicated to preserving and fostering a love of Yiddish music. In their unique mission, the Chorus performs strictly in Yiddish, rediscovering and reinterpreting traditional works from the Eastern European shtetl, as well as new songs with a contemporary sound.  Interestingly, most of the Chorus at this point does not understand Yiddish.  The texts on the sheet music are all written with English letters, the singers are all provided with word-for-word translations, and mp3s are provided to help with the pronunciation (as well as the music, for those who aren't as fluid at reading music).  When the Chorus performs, English translations are always provided.  At this point, much of the Chorus's audience is younger;  and the combination of the translations given, with the Chorus's manner of performing leaves the Yiddish-challenged in the audience feeling like they understood everything.

Founded in 1922 as the "Freiheit Gezang Farein," and then known from 1948 through 2021 as the Jewish People's Philharmonic Chorus / JPPC, the Chorus began as a musical expression of the Jewish labor movement. It has evolved into an intergenerational chorus with a solid reputation as an interpreter of a wide range of choral material. One of the longest regularly performing Yiddish choruses in North America, the Chorus currently has around 40 members, as well as a smaller chamber ensemble for special events.

Performing for diverse audiences in the greater New York area has enabled the Chorus to carry Yiddish music to people of all ages, in many different kinds of locales.  Recent venues have included Lincoln Center, Shea Stadium, Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun (NYC), the World Trade Center site after 9/11, the Museum of the City of New York, the North American Jewish Choral Festival, Queens College, Riverside Church (NYC), Symphony Space, and West Point Military Academy.

*Zingt! A Celebration of Yiddish Choral Music*, the Chorus's first CD, was released in 2006. Committed to bringing Yiddish music into the 21st Century, this CD continues a long tradition of recordings that began in 1948. Generous donations to the Chorus by individuals and foundations provided the impetus for this project.  The CD includes "*Reb Dovidl*," "*Shoyshanas Yaakoyv*," "*Vaserl*," and much more. In addition, a live-in-concert DVD has been released of a 2007 concert the Chorus gave focusing on the works of the two great Yiddish songwriters, Warshawsky and Gebirtig, including songs like "*Afn pripetshik*," "*Akhtsik er un zibetsik zi*," "*Es brent*" & "*Di mizinke oysgegebn*."

Binyumen Schaechter has conducted the Chorus since 1995. If you would like to be placed on their mailing list, audition for the chorus, or to send a tax-deductible contribution, you can contact them for more information via their email address [info@YiddishChorus.org](mailto:info@yiddishchorus.org).

For their 2012 gala concert entitled *Bridging Two Worlds: A Yiddish Musical Journey*, the Chorus revived an old tradition - preparing a special keepsake Journal that was given to all who attended the concert, which had photos and bios of all the singers, the full program of the concert, articles about the Chorus and its history, and ads taken out by individuals, businesses and organizations, to honor a current Chorus member, to remember one who has passed, and/or to promote a business or an organization.  We have continued the tradition each year since then.  If you would like to take out one or more ads in a future Journal or write an article for it, please contact Paulette at [info@YiddishChorus.org](mailto:info@yiddishchorus.org).

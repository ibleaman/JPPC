# The Yiddish Philharmonic Chorus

![The Yiddish Philharmonic Chorus](img/2010.jpg "The Yiddish Philharmonic Chorus, 2010"){: .rounded .mx-auto .d-block }

The **Yiddish Philharmonic Chorus** is a New York City-based audition chorus dedicated to preserving and fostering a love of Yiddish music. In their unique mission, the Chorus performs strictly in Yiddish, rediscovering and reinterpreting traditional works from the Eastern European shtetl, as well as new songs with a contemporary sound.  Interestingly, most of the Chorus at this point does not understand Yiddish.  The texts on the sheet music are all written with English letters, the singers are all provided with word-for-word translations, and mp3s are provided to help with the pronunciation (as well as the music, for those who aren't as fluid at reading music).  When the Chorus performs, English translations are always provided.  At this point, much of the Chorus's audience is younger;  and the combination of the translations given, with the Chorus's manner of performing leaves the Yiddish-challenged in the audience feeling like they understood everything.

Founded in 1922 as the "Freiheit Gezang Farein," and then known from 1948 through 2021 as the Jewish People's Philharmonic Chorus / JPPC, the Chorus began as a musical expression of the Jewish labor movement. It has evolved into an intergenerational chorus with a solid reputation as an interpreter of a wide range of choral material. One of the longest regularly performing Yiddish choruses in North America, the Chorus currently has around 40 members, as well as a smaller chamber ensemble for special events.

Performing for diverse audiences in the greater New York area has enabled the Chorus to carry Yiddish music to people of all ages, in many different kinds of locales.  Recent venues have included Lincoln Center, Shea Stadium, Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun (NYC), the World Trade Center site after 9/11, the Museum of the City of New York, the North American Jewish Choral Festival, Queens College, Riverside Church (NYC), Symphony Space, and West Point Military Academy.

*Zingt! A Celebration of Yiddish Choral Music*, the Chorus's first CD, was released in 2006. Committed to bringing Yiddish music into the 21st Century, this CD continues a long tradition of recordings that began in 1948. Generous donations to the Chorus by individuals and foundations provided the impetus for this project.  The CD includes "*Reb Dovidl*," "*Shoyshanas Yaakoyv*," "*Vaserl*," and much more. In addition, a live-in-concert DVD has been released of a 2007 concert the Chorus gave focusing on the works of the two great Yiddish songwriters, Warshawsky and Gebirtig, including songs like "*Afn pripetshik*," "*Akhtsik er un zibetsik zi*," "*Es brent*" & "*Di mizinke oysgegebn*."

Binyumen Schaechter has conducted the Chorus since 1995. If you would like to be placed on their mailing list, audition for the chorus, or to send a tax-deductible contribution, you can contact them for more information via their email address [info@YiddishChorus.org](mailto:info@yiddishchorus.org).

For their 2012 gala concert entitled *Bridging Two Worlds: A Yiddish Musical Journey*, the Chorus revived an old tradition - preparing a special keepsake Journal that was given to all who attended the concert, which had photos and bios of all the singers, the full program of the concert, articles about the Chorus and its history, and ads taken out by individuals, businesses and organizations, to honor a current Chorus member, to remember one who has passed, and/or to promote a business or an organization.  We have continued the tradition each year since then.  If you would like to take out one or more ads in a future Journal or write an article for it, please contact Paulette at [info@YiddishChorus.org](mailto:info@yiddishchorus.org).

# The Conductor

**Binyumen Schaechter** has conducted the Chorus since 1995. In addition to leading the ensemble, he creates contemporary arrangements for much of our repertoire. He’s transformed classics like [*“Dayenu”*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3R98uechsQ) and adapted current tunes like *The Godfather* theme into modern Yiddish choral works. He promotes Yiddish language and culture by teaching singers to correctly pronounce and interpret lyrics and to understand the history of each song they perform.

Aside from his leading role in the choral world, Binyumen (known as Ben in non-Yiddish circles) is an award-winning composer of musicals, revue songs, and cabaret songs. Off-Broadway shows featuring his music include *Naked Boys Singing* (the fourth-longest-running show in off-Broadway history), *Pets!* (about people and their relationship with their pets), *That’s Life!* (nominated for an Outer Critics Circle Award), and *Too Jewish?* (nominated for the Drama Desk and Outer Critics Circle Awards). His music for *Double Identity* was praised by The New York Times for its “ear- catching score.” *It Helps To Sing About It,* a revue of songs he composed with lyricist Dan Kael, won the 2018 ASCAP-Bistro Award for Outstanding Musical Revue. Ben and Dan’s “I Can Tell Time” earned them the 2018 MAC Award for Best Song, and “Apply” made them finalists for Best Comedy Song. These two numbers and others from the show are on YouTube.

As a translator of arias and songs into Yiddish (his native tongue), Binyumen has crafted singable Yiddish translations of many songs,
including “Anything You Can Do,” “Auld Lang Syne,” “Baby, It’s Cold Outside,” “Over the Rainbow,” the “Habañera” from Carmen, and Puccini’s *“O, Mio Babbino Caro.”*

Binyumen often presents at conferences and festivals on topics relating to Yiddish music and the Yiddish language. Three popular topics are “Ashkenazic Family Names: What Our Names Mean About Our Families,” “How to Sing in Yiddish So That It Sounds Like Yiddish,” and, from an autobiographical perspective, “How It Came to Be, in 21st Century America, That Our Entire Extended Family Speaks Yiddish.” On his own, he has also toured with “The Yiddish Top Chai—A Sing-along Countdown of the 18 Yiddish Songs People Most Love to Sing.”

He toured for many years with both of his Yiddish-speaking actor-singer daughters, [*Di Shekhter-tekhter*](http://yiddishsisters.com/) performing in Australia, Brazil, Europe, Israel, and North America and played a central role in their 2012 documentary film, [*When Our Bubbas and Zeydas Were Young: The Schaechter Sisters on Stage*](https://jewishvideo.com/shop/ols/products/when-our-bubbas-and-zeydas-were-young). He was also musical director of the Pripetshik Singers, the one-of-a-kind ensemble of native-Yiddish-speaking children, documented in the film [*Pripetshik Sings Yiddish!*](https://jewishvideo.com/shop/ols/products/pripetshik-sings-yiddish).

Binyumen and his three sisters were raised in a Yiddish-speaking home by the linguist Dr. Mordkhe Schaechter and Charne Schaechter, *z”l.* The four siblings all speak Yiddish with their own offspring—a combined total of sixteen children and twenty-one grandchildren.

The Jewish People's Philharmonic Chorus (JPPC) is part of the modern Yiddish renaissance. Around forty members strong, singers in this multigenerational ensemble hold a range of occupations, from students to retirees. Some speak or are learning Yiddish; others don’t know the language at all. But each member is committed to strengthening Yiddish as a living language and is drawn by the beautiful Yiddish choral music we learn.

The JPPC is building a century-spanning repertoire — oratorios and operettas, labor anthems, folksongs, and classic popular tunes — all in Yiddish. We have commissioned and premiered new Yiddish choral works by composers Helen Medwedeff Greenberg *z"l*, Robert Ross, Josh Waletzky, Mark Zuckerman, and by our conductor, Binyumen Schaechter.

We share the rich legacy of Yiddish song by performing annually each spring at Symphony Space, most summers at the North American Jewish Choral Festival, and throughout the year at community centers, universities, K-12 schools, museums and places of worship in the New York metropolitan area. We have also performed at Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center, at Ground Zero, and the West Point Military Academy.

The Chorus often performs with soloists, including  [*Di Shekhter-tekhter*](http://yiddishsisters.com/) (The Schaechter Sisters), a one-of-a-kind sister duo that has been delighting audiences all over the world with their all-Yiddish programs since 2008.

The JPPC is always looking for new audiences to which we can reveal the power and beauty of Yiddish choral music. If you would like your group to have this moving experience, we are ready to help plan a program for you. We can provide either an entire concert or perform several numbers to enhance a commemoration or special event.

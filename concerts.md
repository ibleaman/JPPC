# *** UPCOMING CONCERT ***

_____

*********

The Jewish people, in October 2023, faced the worst violence since the Holocaust. Throughout history, we have responded to hatred with optimism and defiance. In this upcoming concert, come hear the Yiddish Philharmonic Chorus, an intergenerational ensemble led by Binyumen Schaechter, perform a variety of Yiddish anthems, theater songs, and a liturgical setting, all in some way rallying for solidarity or declaring the need for freedom.  

**ENGLISH TRANSLATIONS PROVIDED**  

This concert is excerpts from our June and October 2023 Merkin Hall performances, named **Chutzpah!  Yiddish Songs of Defiance**.  It features brand-new choral arrangements and familiar songs you'll hear in a completely different way. Even if you don't know a word of Yiddish, the song intros and English supertitles will keep you fully engaged and in the spirit. The concert also honors two historic acts of defiance: the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising (80 years ago) and the founding of the state of Israel (75 years ago).  

**PROGRAM**

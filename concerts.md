# *** UPCOMING CONCERTS ***

_____

*********

The Jewish people, in October 2023, faced the worst violence since the Holocaust. Throughout history, we have responded to hatred with optimism and defiance. In these two upcoming concerts, come hear the Yiddish Philharmonic Chorus, an intergenerational ensemble led by Binyumen Schaechter, perform a variety of Yiddish anthems, theater songs, and a liturgical setting, all in some way rallying for solidarity or declaring the need for freedom.  

*ENGLISH TRANSLATIONS PROVIDED*  

These concerts feature brand-new choral arrangements and familiar songs you'll hear in a completely different way. Even if you don't know a word of Yiddish, the song intros and English supertitles will keep you fully engaged and in the spirit. The concert also honors two historic acts of defiance: the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising (80 years ago) and the founding of the state of Israel (75 years ago).  

**PROGRAM**  
*Ba di taykhn fun Bovl* (Psalm 137 in Yiddish) ~ *Dona, Dona* ~  
*Harbstlid ~ Hey, hey, daloy politsey ~ Di hofenung* (*Hatikvah* in Yiddish) ~  
*In kamf ~ Minutn fun bitokhn ~ Partizaner-himen* ~  
*Yerusholayem, shtot fun gold (Yerushalayim shel zahav* in Yiddish) ~  
songs by Beyle Schaechter-Gottesman ~  
selections from the Yiddish musical *Shver tsu zayn a yid*

2024 marks 100 years since the infamous Immigration Act of 1924 (The Johnson-Reed Act), which severely limited the number of immigrants that could seek freedom in America, which then made it well-nigh impossible for Jews trying to escape the Holocaust to do so. Come hear the Yiddish Philharmonic Chorus, the acclaimed, intergenerational ensemble led by Binyumen Schaechter, perform a variety of Yiddish songs on the theme of immigration.

This concert will feature brand-new choral arrangements and familiar songs you'll hear in a completely different way, as well as some total surprises for everyone. Even if you don't know a word of Yiddish, the song intros and English supertitles will keep you fully engaged and in the spirit. 

The concert will conclude with a new Yiddish choral adaptation of Beethoven’s “Ode to Joy” from his Ninth Symphony, to mark the 200th anniversary of the premiere of that work in 1824.  We also honor two historic acts of defiance: the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising (80 years ago) and the founding of the state of Israel (75 years ago).

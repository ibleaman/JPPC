# *** UPCOMING CONCERT ***

_____

*********

### * FROM VARSHE AND VILNE TO VASHINGTON HEIGHTS *  

**ENGLISH TRANSLATIONS PROVIDED**  

### Sunday, June 16, 2024 – Father's Day
### 1:00 p.m.

**Merkin Hall  
129 West 67th Street  
New York, New York**

Come hear the Yiddish Philharmonic Chorus, the acclaimed, intergenerational ensemble led by Binyumen Schaechter, perform a variety of Yiddish songs on the theme of Jewish immigration.

2024 marks a century since the infamous Immigration Act of 1924 (The Johnson-Reed Act) severely limited the number of immigrants allowed into America, preventing many Jews from escaping the Holocaust.

Our concert will feature brand-new choral arrangements, familiar songs you'll hear in a completely different way, and some total surprises for everyone. Even if you don't know a word of Yiddish, the song intros and English supertitles will keep you fully engaged and in the spirit.

We’ll end with a new Yiddish choral adaptation of “Ode to Joy” from Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony, a work premiered 200 years ago, with a Yiddish translation that promotes the “melting pot” idea.
